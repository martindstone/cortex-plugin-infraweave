# Getting Started with the Cortex Plugin Sample

Welcome! This sample plugin demonstrates a full ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù Cortex plugin setup including routing, theming, UI components, context hooks, and request proxy. Use it as a starting point for your own plugin development.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Inside

The plugin ships with five example tabs:

1. **Components**  
  Demonstrates the ready-to-use UI components included in `@cortexapps/react-plugin-ui`.

2. **Context**  
  Shows your current plugin context via the `usePluginContextProvider` hook (entity info, user info, theme, and more; available from the `PluginContextProvider` component).

4. **Entity**  
  Renders details for the current entity:  
  - Descriptor from the `useEntityDescriptor` hook
  - Custom data from the `useEntityCustomData` hook
  - Custom events from the `useEntityCustomEvents` hook

4. **Colors**  
  Generates swatches of the theme variables applied by `<PluginStyler>` (supports light mode and dark mode).

5. **Proxy**  
  A simple REST fetch tester that makes requests through your plugin proxy, for trying out backend endpoints.

## üìÅ Code Layout

- **Build target**  
  Webpack is preconfigured to bundle everything into `dist/ui.html` ‚Äî you‚Äôll see module-size warnings during build; you can ignore them, as they don‚Äôt affect this environment.

- **Tests**  
  Jest is already set up for component testing. See `src/App.test.tsx` for a minimal example.

- **Plugin Initialization**  
  index.tsx calls the init hook as early as possible to avoid a flash:
  ```ts
  // src/index.tsx
  import App from "./components/App";
  import { CortexApi } from "@cortexapps/plugin-core";

  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    CortexApi.pluginInit();

    const container = document.getElementById("cortex-plugin-root");
    const root = createRoot(container!);
    root.render(<App />);
  });
  ```

- **Plugin Shell**  
  The main component, `<AppTabs>`, is wrapped in a `<RoutingPluginProvider>`:
  ```tsx
  // src/components/App.tsx
  import type React from "react";

  import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
  import PluginProvider from "./RoutingPluginProvider";
  import ErrorBoundary from "./ErrorBoundary";
  import AppTabs from "./AppTabs";

  import "../baseStyles.css";

  const App: React.FC = () => {
    const queryClient = new QueryClient();

    return (
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          <PluginProvider enableRouting initialEntries={["/basic"]}>
            <AppTabs />
          </PluginProvider>
        </QueryClientProvider>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    );
  };

  export default App;
  ```

  The routing plugin provider includes:  
  - `<PluginRouter>`, which wraps React Router and persists URLs in the query string ‚Äî supports deep links via `useLocation` and `useNavigate`. Routing functionality in the plugin provider is turned on when you provide the `enableRouting` and `initialEntries` props.
  - `<PluginStyler>`, which injects theme CSS variables into the iframe‚Äôs document element.
  - `<PluginContextProvider>`, which exposes `usePluginContext()` for entity, user, theme, and other plugin context.

## üíª Recommended Development Workflow

1. **Build the sample**  
   ```bash
   yarn && yarn build
   ```
   This produces `dist/ui.html`.

2. **Register and upload**  
   - Create a draft plugin in Cortex.  
   - Upload `dist/ui.html` as the plugin bundle.

3. **Run the dev server locally**  
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   This starts a live-reload server for rapid iteration.

4. **Enable dev mode**  
   In the plugin settings, turn **Dev Mode** so Cortex loads from your local server instead of the published bundle. Keep this window open as you do your development so that you can see your changes as you make them.

5. **Add your component**  
   - Create a new file under `src/components/`.  
   - Add a tab in `src/components/AppTabs.tsx`:
    ```tsx
    // src/components/AppTabs.tsx
    import MyNewComponent from './components/MyNewComponent';

    const tabs = [
      { path: '/new', label: 'New', element: <MyNewComponent /> },
      ...
    ];
    ```

6. **Develop and test**  
   - Build your component using the information in the **Components**, **Context**, **Entity**, and **Proxy** tabs.
   - Write Jest tests alongside your components, named as `ComponentName.test.tsx`

7. **Cleanup**  
   Before release, remove any sample tabs you don‚Äôt need from the `AppTabs` component. If your plugin is single-page, you can mount your main component directly under the plugin provider and remove the `enableRouting` and `initialEntries` props.

Happy coding! üéâ
